      <h1>Home</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! This is my homepage that I will be working on improving in the upcoming months. 
        Feel free to look around the other pages from this site while I work on adding more to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website was made by myself 100% from scratch using just HTML and CSS. 
        Even the tab icon was done by me using paint.net! 
        There's still a lot of work that needs to be done on this place, but that'll all come in due time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to think about a person's website as their own digital backyard on the internet. 
        Or perhaps a garden is a better analogy? 
        You gotta take good care of it regularly and give it tiny little improvements over time to make it look pretty.
      </p>
